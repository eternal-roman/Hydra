## [2.0.0] — 2026-04-02

### Added
- **3-agent AI reasoning pipeline** (`hydra_brain.py`) — Claude + Grok evaluate every BUY/SELL signal before execution.
  - **Market Analyst** (Claude Sonnet) — analyzes indicators, regime, price action; produces thesis, conviction, agreement/disagreement with engine signal.
  - **Risk Manager** (Claude Sonnet) — evaluates portfolio risk, drawdown, exposure; produces CONFIRM / ADJUST / OVERRIDE decision with size multiplier.
  - **Strategic Advisor** (Grok 4 Reasoning) — called only on contested decisions (ADJUST/OVERRIDE or conviction < 0.65). Re-evaluates with full context from both prior agents and makes the final call.
- Multi-provider support: Anthropic Claude (primary) + xAI Grok (strategist). Both keys configurable via `.env`.
- Intelligent escalation: clear CONFIRM signals skip Grok (~$0.008/decision), contested signals escalate (~$0.011/decision).
- AI reasoning displayed in dashboard: decision badges (CONFIRM/ADJUST/OVERRIDE), analyst thesis, risk assessment, Grok strategist reasoning (when escalated), risk flags.
- AI Brain sidebar panel: decisions, overrides, escalations, strategist status, API cost, latency, active/offline status.
- Header badge switches to "AI LIVE" when brain is active.
- 5-layer fallback system: single failure, repeated failures (disable 30 min), budget exceeded, missing API key, timeout.
- Daily cost guard (`max_daily_cost`) prevents runaway API spend.
- 8 new brain tests (fallback, budget guard, JSON parser, prompt builders, caching). Total: 62 tests.

### Changed
- Agent now routes BUY/SELL signals through 3-agent AI pipeline before execution (HOLD signals skip AI to save cost).
- Trade log includes AI reasoning when brain is active.
- Dashboard shows AI reasoning inline in each pair panel, with Grok strategist panel on escalated decisions.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- **Competition mode** (`--mode competition`) — half-Kelly sizing, 50% confidence threshold, 40% max position. Optimized for the lablab.ai AI Trading Agents hackathon (March 30 — April 12, 2026, $55k prize pool).
- **Paper trading** (`--paper`) — uses `kraken paper buy/sell` commands. No API keys needed, no real money at risk. Safe strategy validation before going live.
- **Competition results export** — `competition_results_{timestamp}.json` with per-pair PnL, drawdown, Sharpe, trade log, and session metadata for submission proof.
- **Configurable position sizing** — `PositionSizer` is now an instance with configurable `kelly_multiplier`, `min_confidence`, and `max_position_pct`. Two presets: `SIZING_CONSERVATIVE` and `SIZING_COMPETITION`.
- 7 new tests: competition sizing threshold, larger positions, higher max, half-Kelly ratio, preset validation, engine mode acceptance, defaults check. Total: 54 tests.

### Changed
- `PositionSizer` refactored from static class to configurable instance — breaks no external API, all existing behavior preserved via `SIZING_CONSERVATIVE` default.
- Dead man's switch and order validation skip in paper mode (not needed).
- Agent banner shows trading mode (LIVE/PAPER) and sizing mode (CONSERVATIVE/COMPETITION).
- Default `--interval` changed to 30s (was 60s).

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- Core trading engine (`hydra_engine.py`) with pure Python indicators: EMA, RSI (Wilder's), ATR, Bollinger Bands, MACD (proper 9-EMA signal line)
- Four-regime detection: TREND_UP, TREND_DOWN, RANGING, VOLATILE — with priority ordering (volatile overrides trends)
- Four trading strategies: Momentum, Mean Reversion, Grid, Defensive — each with BUY/SELL/HOLD signal generation
- Quarter-Kelly position sizing with hard limits (30% max position, 55% confidence threshold, $0.50 minimum)
- Circuit breaker at 15% max drawdown — halts all trading automatically
- Live trading agent (`hydra_agent.py`) connecting to Kraken via kraken-cli (WSL)
- Limit post-only orders (`--type limit --oflags post`) — maker fees, no spread crossing
- Order validation via `--validate` before every execution
- Dead man's switch (`kraken order cancel-after 60`) refreshed every tick
- Rate limiting — minimum 2 seconds between every Kraken API call
- Three trading pairs: SOL/USDC, SOL/XBT, XBT/USDC (full coin triangle)
- WebSocket broadcast server (port 8765) for real-time dashboard communication
- React + Vite live dashboard (`dashboard/`) with:
  - Candlestick charts (80 candles per pair, responsive SVG)
  - Signal confidence meter with color-coded BUY/SELL/HOLD
  - Per-pair regime detection with strategy matrix
  - Balance history line chart
  - Scrollable trade log with status indicators
  - Kraken account balance (cached every 5th tick)
  - Session configuration panel
  - Auto-reconnecting WebSocket with connection status indicator
- Three-headed Hydra SVG favicon with purple/cyan color scheme
- Smart price formatting (`fmtPrice`) handling $0.0012 to $67,000
- Smart indicator formatting (`fmtInd`) with dynamic decimal precision
- Auto-restart launcher scripts (`start_all.bat`, `start_hydra.bat`, `start_dashboard.bat`)
- Windows Startup shortcut via `create_shortcut.ps1`
- Continuous mode (`--duration 0`) for indefinite operation
- Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C) with final performance report and trade log export
- SKILL.md agent skill definition for Claude Code / MCP compatibility
- AUDIT.md technical audit report (49 tests, all passing)
- Cross-pair regime swap detection (advisory logging)

### Fixed
- RSI: Replaced simple sum with Wilder's exponential smoothing
- MACD: Replaced incorrect `signal = macd * constant` with proper 9-EMA of historical MACD series
- Orders: Changed from market orders to limit post-only (maker)
- Rate limiting: Added 2s sleep between every API call (was batching multiple calls instantly)
- Trade log: Now logs actual limit price instead of engine's internal price
- Dead man's switch: Now refreshed every tick (was every 2nd tick, risking expiry)
- Dashboard balance: Cached every 5th tick (was fetching every tick, wasting API calls)
- Indicator precision: Dynamic decimals based on price magnitude (fixed SOL/XBT showing 0.00)
- Continuous mode: Fixed TypeError when `remaining` was string in dashboard state
- Performance report: Replaced misaligned box-drawing characters with clean ASCII formatting
