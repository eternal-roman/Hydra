## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-01

### Added
- Core trading engine (`hydra_engine.py`) with pure Python indicators: EMA, RSI (Wilder's), ATR, Bollinger Bands, MACD (proper 9-EMA signal line)
- Four-regime detection: TREND_UP, TREND_DOWN, RANGING, VOLATILE — with priority ordering (volatile overrides trends)
- Four trading strategies: Momentum, Mean Reversion, Grid, Defensive — each with BUY/SELL/HOLD signal generation
- Quarter-Kelly position sizing with hard limits (30% max position, 55% confidence threshold, $0.50 minimum)
- Circuit breaker at 15% max drawdown — halts all trading automatically
- Live trading agent (`hydra_agent.py`) connecting to Kraken via kraken-cli (WSL)
- Limit post-only orders (`--type limit --oflags post`) — maker fees, no spread crossing
- Order validation via `--validate` before every execution
- Dead man's switch (`kraken order cancel-after 60`) refreshed every tick
- Rate limiting — minimum 2 seconds between every Kraken API call
- Three trading pairs: SOL/USDC, SOL/XBT, XBT/USDC (full coin triangle)
- WebSocket broadcast server (port 8765) for real-time dashboard communication
- React + Vite live dashboard (`dashboard/`) with:
  - Candlestick charts (80 candles per pair, responsive SVG)
  - Signal confidence meter with color-coded BUY/SELL/HOLD
  - Per-pair regime detection with strategy matrix
  - Balance history line chart
  - Scrollable trade log with status indicators
  - Kraken account balance (cached every 5th tick)
  - Session configuration panel
  - Auto-reconnecting WebSocket with connection status indicator
- Three-headed Hydra SVG favicon with purple/cyan color scheme
- Smart price formatting (`fmtPrice`) handling $0.0012 to $67,000
- Smart indicator formatting (`fmtInd`) with dynamic decimal precision
- Auto-restart launcher scripts (`start_all.bat`, `start_hydra.bat`, `start_dashboard.bat`)
- Windows Startup shortcut via `create_shortcut.ps1`
- Continuous mode (`--duration 0`) for indefinite operation
- Graceful shutdown (Ctrl+C) with final performance report and trade log export
- SKILL.md agent skill definition for Claude Code / MCP compatibility
- AUDIT.md technical audit report (49 tests, all passing)
- Cross-pair regime swap detection (advisory logging)

### Fixed
- RSI: Replaced simple sum with Wilder's exponential smoothing
- MACD: Replaced incorrect `signal = macd * constant` with proper 9-EMA of historical MACD series
- Orders: Changed from market orders to limit post-only (maker)
- Rate limiting: Added 2s sleep between every API call (was batching multiple calls instantly)
- Trade log: Now logs actual limit price instead of engine's internal price
- Dead man's switch: Now refreshed every tick (was every 2nd tick, risking expiry)
- Dashboard balance: Cached every 5th tick (was fetching every tick, wasting API calls)
- Indicator precision: Dynamic decimals based on price magnitude (fixed SOL/XBT showing 0.00)
- Continuous mode: Fixed TypeError when `remaining` was string in dashboard state
- Performance report: Replaced misaligned box-drawing characters with clean ASCII formatting
